| **Stage**             | **Description**                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Build Information**  | The device and OS details. It tells us the Android version, device model, and build configuration.                   |
| **ABI**               | The architecture of the processor in use. In this case, it is `arm64`, indicating a 64-bit ARM processor.            |
| **Timestamp**         | The exact time when the crash happened. Helpful for identifying when the issue occurred in real-time.                 |
| **Process and Thread**| Provides the process ID (`pid`) and thread ID (`tid`). Since both are the same, the crash occurred in the main thread.|
| **App Name**          | The name of the application where the crash occurred (`com.example.testapp`).                                        |
| **Signal**            | `Signal 11 (SIGSEGV)` indicates a segmentation fault, which usually means the app tried to access restricted memory.  |
| **Code**              | `SEGV_MAPERR` (Code 1) suggests that the app tried to access an unmapped memory area.                                |
| **Fault Address**     | The memory address that triggered the fault was `0x0`, indicating a null pointer dereference (invalid memory access). |
| **Cause**             | Confirms the issue: the app attempted to dereference a null pointer, leading to the segmentation fault.               |
| **Register Values**   | Shows the values of the CPU registers at the time of the crash. This data is typically used for low-level debugging.  |
| **Backtrace**         | A step-by-step trace of function calls leading to the crash. Helps locate the exact function and file causing the error.|
| **Crash Location**    | The crash occurred in the `libexample.so` library in the function `com::example::Crasher::crash() const`.             |
| **Thread Involvement**| The error was likely caused by a specific thread (`runCrashThread()`), possibly indicating concurrency issues.        |
| **System Libraries**  | The last steps in the backtrace show the crash involving system-level libraries (`libc.so`), specifically thread management. |

According to [Phoenixnap](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/sigsegv), Signal 11, also known as SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault), is an error signal in Unix systems like Linux. This error occurs when a program tries to access an invalid memory location. In response, the operating system sends the SIGSEGV error to the program.

In this case, the crash was caused by dereferencing a null pointer in the native library `libexample.so`, specifically in the function `com::example::Crasher::crash()`. The segmentation fault happened when the app attempted to access an invalid memory address (`0x0`), which is typical of null pointer dereferencing. The trace also suggests this issue might be related to thread handling, as it involves a specific thread, potentially indicating concurrency issues within the application.

### Suggestions to Resolve:
1. **Check and Safeguard Against Null Pointer Access**: Ensure that all pointers are properly initialized and check for `null` before dereferencing them.

2. **Debug the Native Library (`libexample.so`)**: 
   - In development, recompile the native library with debugging symbols enabled. This will make it easier to identify the exact cause of the crash, as class names and function symbols will be included in the trace.
   - In release builds, native libraries typically have their symbol tables and debugging information removed to reduce the overall app size. While this improves performance and minimizes storage usage, it complicates the process of diagnosing crashes through tools like the Google Play Console. According to [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/crash?hl=pt-br), this can hinder effective crash analysis.
