## 2. Describe the event occurred in the message log:

```
avc: denied { read write } for pid=1876 comm="syslogd"
name="xconsole" dev=tmpfs ino=5510
scontext=system_u:system_r:syslogd_t:s0
tcontext=system_u:object_r:device_t:s0 tclass=fifo_file permissive=1
```


## Answer

According to [O Manual do Administrador Debian (14.5. Introducao ao SELinux) ](https://l.github.io/debian-handbook/html/pt-BR/sect.selinux.html)

| Message     | Description     |
|----------------|----------------|
| avc: denied   | An operation was denied.  |
| { read write }   | This operation required read and write permissions.    |
| pid=1876   | The process with PID 1876 executed (or attempted to execute) the operation.    |
| comm="syslogd"   | The process was an instance of the syslogd program.   |
| name="xconsole"   | The target object was named xconsole.   |
| dev=tmpfs   | The device hosting the target object is a tmpfs (a filesystem in memory). |
| ino=5510    | The object is identified by inode number 5510.   |
| scontext=system_u:system_r:syslogd_t:s0   | This is the security context of the process that executed the operation.   |
| tcontext=system_u:object_r:device_t:s0   | This is the security context of the target object.   |
| tclass=fifo_file   | The target object is a FIFO file. |


In the source, the following operation was performed: the creation of an `SELinux` policy for an application called `myapp`, using a `.te` file with various directives and macros to define permissions and file types. The policy includes type declarations (such as `myapp_t`, `myapp_exec_t`, etc.) and specific permissions, such as allowing `myapp_t` to read and write log files and manage temporary files.

It was suggested to create a rule that allows the `syslogd_t` process to access the ``FIFO`` file xconsole with the necessary read and write permissions. The suggested rule is: 

```
allow syslogd_t device_t:fifo_file { read write }
```

Additionally, it was recommended to use the `audit2allow` tool to automatically generate rules based on log entries, carefully reviewing the generated rules to ensure they grant only the necessary permissions. If the denied operation is not critical, consider adding a `dontaudit` rule to prevent log pollution with denial messages.
